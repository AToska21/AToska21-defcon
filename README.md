These are cogs I have written for Red Bot.  
View them on the [Red Portal (beta)](https://cogs.red/cogs/ptoast/FlapJack-Cogs/)

- **ReactPoll** - Functions exactly like Red's built-in polls, but uses numeric reactions instead of typed responses.
- **Blizzard** - Fetches and prints latest patch notes and some (limited) user data from current Blizzard games.
- **ColorMe** - Allows users to manage the color of their own name through custom roles with default permissions.
- **Defcon** - A nod to the 1983 film War Games. Maintain a DEFCON system on your server, displayed through creative use of embeds.
- **Dongers** - Fetches and prints a random donger from www.dongerlist.com.
- **SmartReact** - Set up automatic emoji reactions to specific words in chat.
- **gtts** - Experimental cog using the Google TTS service and tmerc's playsound code to play TTS in a voice channel.
